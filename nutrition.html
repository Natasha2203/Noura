            <h3>Why We Need Food and Energy</h3>
            <p>Humans need food because it provides the energy required for every function in the body. Energy is used not only to move but also for all organs to work properly, including breathing and even sleeping, which actually burns a significant amount of calories. The total energy the body uses in a day comes from three parts: resting energy expenditure, physical activity energy expenditure, and the thermic effect of food. Of these, two are largely constant and necessary for survival, regardless of how active you are.</p>

            <h3>Factors Influencing Basal Metabolic Rate</h3>
            <p>The basal metabolic rate varies from person to person and depends on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and nutrition. While age, gender, and height are straightforward factors, weight has a more nuanced effect because it depends on the amount of fat-free mass a person has—such as muscle, organs, and bones—which requires more energy to maintain than fat mass. Having more muscle increases energy needs. Nutrition also plays a role because some foods require more energy to digest, with protein demanding the most energy and fat the least. Additionally, processed foods are easier to digest and use less energy.

            <h3>Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>The resting energy use and digestion-related energy are mostly fixed, but the most effective way to increase total energy expenditure is through physical activity. Physical activity can be exercise, which is planned and structured, or non-exercise activities like walking or doing errands. The energy spent during physical activity also depends on factors such as age, gender, height, and weight, with heavier or taller people burning more calories doing the same activity. Overall, most daily energy is used for basic functions such as breathing and maintaining body temperature.</p>

            <h3>Macronutrients and Their Roles</h3>
            <p>The body requires three essential macronutrients: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Proteins serve as the building blocks for the body, supporting cell growth and repair. Fats help with the absorption of vitamins and hormone regulation. Carbohydrates are the body’s primary energy source. While all three are necessary, the body requires them in different proportions. Roughly, daily calories should come from 45 to 65 percent carbohydrates, 20 to 30 percent fats, and 10 to 35 percent protein. These percentages can vary widely depending on individual needs and lifestyle.</p>
